This project intends to provide a platform to manage and control a beer craft process. With the help of a configured Arduino board, we could be able to retrieve realtime data like temperature or density and show a graphic with the evolution of those values in time.

It will be necessary to use a Bluetooth sensor connected to Arduino in order to send and receive data from your Android device.

Bluetooth discovery, stablish communication and data transmission. Right now, data tranmission is hardcoded from sender device.
